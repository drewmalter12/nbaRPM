Looking into RPM's for players during the 2015-2016 season 


The NBA RPM stat is a unique stat that attempts to show the value of each player based on how his team performs while he is on the court, who he is on the court with, and who he is on the court against.

The question that came to mind is, "If a big man and a point guard have exactly the same RPM, and all variables are equal, then who is 'more valuable'? I found that in general, big men are easier to replace than guards. The top guards in the league have outlying RPM's relative to other guards, however the top centers in the league seem to be easier to replace. (i.e. the distribution of Center RPM's is relatively thin)


Note: Many basketball analysts do not categorize players by position, but rather the type of player they are.  However for this project, I used data on positions, mostly just to give us a general idea about the way different types of players affect RPM
