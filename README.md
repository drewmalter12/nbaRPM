Looking into RPM's for players during the 2015-2016 season 


The NBA Real Plus Minus (RPM) is a unique stat that attempts to show the value of each player based on how his team performs while he is on the court, whom he is on the court with, and whom he is on the court against.

As fascinated as I am with this stat, I believe that it does not tell the whole story.  For instance, it does not allow you to fairly compare players of difference positions because the means and standard deviations of the RPM's for each position are different.   I found that in general, centers are easier to replace than point guards and small forwards. The top point guards in the league have outlying RPM's relative to other guards, however the top centers in the league seem to be easier to replace. (i.e. the distribution of Center RPM's is relatively thin)


Note: Many basketball analysts do not categorize players by position, but rather the type of player they are.  However for this project, I used data on positions, mostly just to give us a general idea about the way different types of players affect RPM
