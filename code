# Conclusion: Centers are more replacable than forwards and especially guards
# Although Deandre Jordan has a higher RPM than Ricky Rubio, I would
# Rubio is a more valuable player (all other variables equal) because of the fact
# that it is harder to find another guard who can replace Rubio than it is 
# to find a Center than can replace Jordan. 

# Also, as we shouldn't be surprised, Lebron is the most valuable player 
# in the league and is also the most positive outlier for RPM for his position
